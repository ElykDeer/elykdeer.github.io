Hello, and welcome to my website!

My name is Kyle Martin, and I am a Computer Engineering student at NYU.

On this website you can find...
 - A little bit [About Me](/aboutme/),
 - [Links to my school work](/education/),
 - [An overflow of my extra-curriculars](/osiris/).
 - And [information about my personal projects](/SaplingStudios/).

 If you have any questions at all or just want to chat, please feel free to contact me with either of the emails below.
