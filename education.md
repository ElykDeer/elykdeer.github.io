I am one of New York University's class of 2020.
At NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, I am persuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering.

As of the Summer of 2017, I have completed the following Computer Science courses:
 - CS 1134 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Python 2.x and 3.x)
 - CS 2124 - Object Oriented Programming (C++)

On GitHub, I host all of my CS work that I do for school. This makes it easy for me to backup and transfer code across computers, but it also makes it easy for you to browse my work, [so please feel free][schoolwork].
