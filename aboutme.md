Hello! My name is Kyle Martin, and I am  a Computer Engineering student at NYU.

In 2010 I discovered something called BASIC. I loved it; right there on my iPod Touch, I was able to make tiny games.
I continued on the track of making games that summer, attending ID Tech and the Digital Media Academy, learning C++ and Python respectively.  With those skills, I was able to entertain myself making small applications in my free time.  Eventually I wanted to learn more powerful tools, so I attended National Computer Camps in 2012 and 2013 where I ate up OpenGL, Java, HTML, JavaScript, assembly, and a passing interest in hardware.  Having mastered what they had to teach, I became a counselor in training in 2014, and later the head counselor in 2015.

During this time, I was in attendance at Interlochen Arts Academy, where I studied to be a professional percussionist.
However my interest was too deeply dug in to computer science, so come the fall of 2016 I was enrolled at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering as a Computer Engineering major.  [Read more...](/education/)

Now I am part of the OSIRIS Club, which I maintain the website for and compete in CTF's with. [Read more...](/OSIRIS/)

Outside of school I also have my own company, [SaplingStudios](SaplingStudios), which I mainly use as a penname for my personal projects.
