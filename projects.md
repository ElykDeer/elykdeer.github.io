# Sapling Studios
Sapling Studios is the pen-name that I use to publish the projects that I intend to provide support for an extended period of time on.  Currently, Sapling Studios EMA, PEP, and bananaScript.

EMA is a framework with which to make modular time-based 2D games, while PEP is my first attempt making anything with EMA.  The development of those projects was at their height in the summer of 2017, but since then I have not had nearly as much time as I would like to have to work on them.

bananaScript is an esotaric programming language that I first designed for [CSAW Quals](https://github.com/isislab/CSAW-CTF-2017-Quals/tree/master/rev/bananascript).  The gag behind bananaScript is that all actions and even text-encodings are formed with the word "banana" in different capitalizations.  Here's an example script that prints "Loopy" in an infinite loop:

~~~
banANAS baNanas BaNAnAs BANanaS BANanaS BANanas BAnaNAS
bananas banANAS
bananAS banANAS baNanas bANaNAS BanaNAS
bananAs bananAS banANAS
~~~

# Other Projects

Currently in the works are more esoteric programming languages that cannot yet be disclosed, and of course my ScrapBook.  I am also exploring distributed networks, and code snippets for that will start to filter out of closed-source over some time. One thing I am looking into right now is simulating a simplified version of Tor with some VMs and a lot of code to learn how distributed networks and decision making works at scale.

In the near future I am planning to go back to [SnakeOS](https://github.com/KyleMiles/SnakeOS), and make more flushed-out operating system.
