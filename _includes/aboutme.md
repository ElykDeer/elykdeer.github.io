Hello! My name is Kyle Martin, and I am currently a Computer Engineering student at NYU, class of '20.

My interest in computers ignited back 2010 I when discovered an App called BASIC. Immediately I fell in love; right there on my iPod I was able to make my own tiny creations.  I followed this path recurring summers, attending ID Tech, the Digital Media Academy, and National Computer Camps learning everything I could: C++, Python, OpenGL, Java, HTML/JavaScript/CSS, and Multi-Arch Assembly. You can find more about my education and relevant coursework [here](https://www.github.com/KyleMiles/School).

Since then, I have gone on to teach at National Computer Camps where I led the instruction of all subjects, at my high school for math and science, and at NYU as a TRIO (a Federal Program) tutor for computer science classes.  I am now part of the [OSIRIS Club](/OSIRIS/), for which I maintain the [website](http://blog.isis.poly.edu/osiris.github.io/), compete in CTF's with, and conduct security research at.

All of the code I write is stored on GitHub. My more personal work, such as my school work and my late night scribblings, can be found on [My GitHub Page](https://www.github.com/KyleMiles), whereas I publish my more formal works under then pen-name of [SaplingStudios](SaplingStudios).
