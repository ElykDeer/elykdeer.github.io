EMA and bananaScript can both be found where I publish my more formal projects, in my [SaplingStudios](SaplingStudios) repository.
[My Scrapbook](https://www.github.com/KyleMiles/ScrapBook) contains a breadth of code snippets, be them strange things I found about a programming language or web-crawlers I wrote to test some hypothesis, it's all part of my personal exploration through the technological world.
